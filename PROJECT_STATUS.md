## 🚧 PENDING TASKS

### 13. Email Notification System ⏳ (Not Started - Estimated: 120 min)

**Why Not Implemented:**
Email notifications require external service integration and API keys, which need user decision and setup:

**Options:**
1. **Supabase Edge Functions** (Recommended)
   - Built-in with Supabase
   - Free tier: 500K invocations/month
   - Requires email provider (Resend, SendGrid)

2. **SendGrid**
   - 100 emails/day free
   - Requires API key

3. **Resend**
   - 3,000 emails/month free
   - Modern API, React Email templates

**What Would Be Implemented:**
- Event reminder (24h before)
- Event cancelled notification
- New events in preferred cities
- Feedback received notification
- Notification preferences UI

**User Action Required:**
🟡 **DECISION NEEDED**
1. Choose email provider (Supabase/SendGrid/Resend)
2. Create account and get API key
3. Add API key to environment variables
4. Approve implementation approach

**Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have, not critical for MVP)
