# Soccer Organizer - Application Architecture & Functionality

## üéØ Core Concept

**Soccer Organizer** is a platform that connects soccer event organizers with players. Organizers create events, players pay to join, and the money goes directly to the organizer to cover venue costs.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (React) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Payments**: Stripe Connect
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Key Design Principles
1. **Direct Payments**: Money flows directly from players to organizers (via Stripe Connect)
2. **User-Centric**: Players can join without accounts, organizers need Stripe setup
3. **Real-time**: Supabase provides real-time updates for event participation
4. **Secure**: Supabase RLS policies protect data, Stripe handles payment security
5. **Scalable**: Serverless architecture on Vercel, no server maintenance

## üë• User Roles

### 1. **Regular User (Player)**
- Can browse and join events
- Pay to secure a spot in games
- View their profile and update personal info
- Optional: Create account to track participation history

### 2. **Organizer**
- All User permissions, plus:
- Create and manage soccer events
- Must connect Stripe account to receive payments
- Track event participants and payment status
- Add cash participants manually

### 3. **Admin**
- All Organizer permissions, plus:
- Manage user permissions (grant/revoke event creation rights)
- View all users in the system
- Auto-granted event creation permission
- Created via special setup endpoint with secret key

---

## üîÑ Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: User Registration & Authentication

```
1. User visits /register
2. Fills in: email, password, full name, nickname, phone (optional)
3. System creates:
   - Supabase Auth user
   - User profile in 'users' table
4. Email verification sent (Supabase)
5. User can login at /login
6. Session managed via Supabase Auth cookies
```

**Key Features:**
- Unique nicknames required
- Email verification recommended but not enforced
- Password reset via /auth/reset-password
- Nickname can be changed once per 30 days

### Workflow 2: Organizer Onboarding (Stripe Connect)

```
1. Admin grants can_create_events permission to user
2. User sees "Connect Stripe Account" banner on dashboard
3. User clicks ‚Üí redirected to /connect
4. Clicks "Connect Stripe Account" button
5. System creates Stripe Express account
6. User redirected to Stripe onboarding
7. Completes business info (Poland-based)
   - Individual or business
   - Bank details
   - Identification (PESEL/passport)
8. Returns to app at /connect/return
9. System updates user:
   - stripe_account_id
   - stripe_onboarding_complete = true
   - stripe_charges_enabled = true
   - stripe_payouts_enabled = true
10. User can now create events
```

**Stripe Account States:**
- **Not Connected**: Can't create events
- **Onboarding Incomplete**: Account created but verification pending
- **Fully Connected**: Can receive payments

### Workflow 3: Event Creation

```
1. Organizer must have:
   - can_create_events = true
   - Completed Stripe Connect onboarding
2. Organizer visits /create
3. Fills in event details:
   - Name (e.g., "Friday 6PM - Orlik Mokotow")
   - Date & Time (up to 90 days in advance)
   - Location (venue address)
   - Total Cost (max 1500 PLN)
   - Max Players (max 30)
4. System calculates: price_per_player = total_cost / max_players
5. Event created with organizer_id
6. Organizer can share event link: /event/{id}
```

**Business Rules:**
- Max cost: 1500 PLN (Stripe Connect limit for low-risk)
- Max players: 30
- Max advance booking: 90 days
- Events in the past are rejected
- Price per player auto-calculated

### Workflow 4: Player Joins Event (Payment Flow)

```
1. Player visits /event/{id}
2. Sees event details:
   - Name, date, location
   - Price per player
   - Available spots
   - Current participants
3. Clicks "Pay & Sign Up"
4. Enters:
   - Name (auto-filled if logged in)
   - Email (optional)
   - Chooses name display option (if logged in):
     * Full name
     * Nickname
     * Both
5. Clicks "Pay {amount}"
6. System creates Stripe Checkout session:
   - Payment goes to organizer's Stripe account
   - Platform can optionally take fee (commented out)
7. Redirected to Stripe Checkout page
8. Completes payment (card or BLIK)
9. Stripe sends webhook to /api/webhook
10. Webhook adds participant to database
11. Player redirected to /event/{id}?success=true
12. Sees "Payment successful!" message
```

**Payment Methods Supported:**
- Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- BLIK (Polish mobile payment)

**Stripe Connect Transfer:**
- Money transferred directly to organizer
- Optional platform fee: 5% (currently disabled)
- Transfer happens instantly after payment

### Workflow 5: Event Management (Organizer)

```
1. Organizer visits /event/{id}/manage
2. Sees dashboard:
   - Participant count
   - Money collected vs. target
   - Progress bar
   - List of all participants
3. Can add cash participants:
   - Enter name + email
   - Marked as "Cash" payment
   - Counts toward event capacity
4. Can remove participants:
   - Stripe payments: Organizer must refund manually
   - Cash participants: Just removed from list
5. Can share public event link
```

**Participant Types:**
- **Stripe**: Paid online, has payment_intent_id
- **Cash**: Added manually by organizer

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### `users`
```sql
id                          UUID PRIMARY KEY (from auth.users)
email                       TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
full_name                   TEXT NOT NULL
nickname                    TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
phone                       TEXT
role                        TEXT DEFAULT 'USER' (USER | ADMIN)
can_create_events           BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
email_verified              BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
phone_verified              BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
avatar_url                  TEXT DEFAULT '/default-avatar.svg'
bio                         TEXT
age                         INTEGER
weight                      NUMERIC
height                      NUMERIC
nickname_last_changed       TIMESTAMP
stripe_account_id           TEXT (Stripe Connect account)
stripe_onboarding_complete  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
stripe_charges_enabled      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
stripe_payouts_enabled      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
created_at                  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
updated_at                  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
```

**Key Constraints:**
- `email` is unique (managed by Supabase Auth)
- `nickname` is unique (app-enforced)
- `id` references `auth.users(id)` (Supabase Auth)
- `stripe_account_id` is Stripe Express account ID

#### `events`
```sql
id                  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
name                TEXT NOT NULL
date                TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
location            TEXT NOT NULL
total_cost          NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL
max_players         INTEGER NOT NULL
price_per_player    NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL
organizer_id        UUID REFERENCES users(id)
created_at          TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
updated_at          TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
```

**Business Logic:**
- `price_per_player` auto-calculated on creation
- `organizer_id` must have completed Stripe Connect
- `date` must be in future and within 90 days

#### `participants`
```sql
id                          SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
event_id                    INTEGER REFERENCES events(id)
user_id                     UUID REFERENCES users(id) (nullable)
name                        TEXT NOT NULL
email                       TEXT
avatar_url                  TEXT DEFAULT '/default-avatar.svg'
payment_status              TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' (pending | succeeded | failed)
payment_method              TEXT (stripe | cash)
stripe_payment_intent_id    TEXT (for Stripe payments)
created_at                  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
```

**Participant States:**
- **Stripe Payment**: Has `stripe_payment_intent_id`, status = 'succeeded'
- **Cash Payment**: No payment_intent, status = 'succeeded', added by organizer
- **Guest**: `user_id` is NULL (player joined without account)
- **Registered**: `user_id` is set (logged-in player)

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS enabled:

**Users Table:**
- SELECT: Public (anyone can read user profiles)
- INSERT: Only during signup (service_role for registration)
- UPDATE: Only own profile
- DELETE: Never (soft delete via admin)

**Events Table:**
- SELECT: Public (anyone can view events)
- INSERT: Only users with `can_create_events = true`
- UPDATE: Only event organizer
- DELETE: Only event organizer

**Participants Table:**
- SELECT: Public (anyone can see who's playing)
- INSERT: Via webhook (service_role) or organizer (cash)
- UPDATE: Never
- DELETE: Only event organizer

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow (Supabase Auth)

1. **Session Management**
   - Uses HTTP-only cookies (secure)
   - Middleware refreshes tokens automatically
   - Supabase client handles cookie updates

2. **Auth Context (Client-Side)**
   ```typescript
   - Provides: user, loading, login(), register(), logout()
   - Auto-fetches user profile from database
   - Listens to auth state changes
   - Updates UI reactively
   ```

3. **Server-Side Auth**
   ```typescript
   - getSupabaseUser(): Gets user from server
   - createServerSupabaseClient(): Server Supabase client
   - Used in API routes and server components
   ```

### Permission Hierarchy

```
PUBLIC (no auth)
  ‚Üì
USER (authenticated)
  - View events
  - Join events
  - Edit own profile
  ‚Üì
ORGANIZER (can_create_events = true)
  - All USER permissions
  - Create events
  - Manage own events
  - Add cash participants
  ‚Üì
ADMIN (role = 'ADMIN')
  - All ORGANIZER permissions
  - Grant/revoke permissions
  - View all users
  - Access /admin panel
```

---

## üí≥ Payment Architecture (Stripe Connect)

### Payment Flow

```
Player ‚Üí Stripe Checkout ‚Üí Organizer's Stripe Account
                ‚Üì
           Webhook Event
                ‚Üì
        Add to Database
```

### Stripe Integration Components

#### 1. **Checkout Session Creation** (`/api/simple-checkout`)
```typescript
- Fetches event + organizer Stripe account
- Validates organizer has completed onboarding
- Creates Stripe Checkout Session with:
  * payment_method_types: ['card', 'blik']
  * transfer_data.destination: organizer's stripe_account_id
  * metadata: eventId, participantName, email, userId
- Returns checkout URL
```

#### 2. **Webhook Handler** (`/api/webhook`)
```typescript
- Listens for: checkout.session.completed
- Verifies signature (STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
- Extracts metadata from session
- Inserts participant into database
- Returns 200 OK to Stripe
```

#### 3. **Connect Onboarding** (`/api/connect/onboarding`)
```typescript
- Creates Stripe Express Account (Poland)
- Enables: card_payments, blik_payments, transfers
- Creates AccountLink for onboarding
- Stores stripe_account_id in database
```

#### 4. **Connect Status** (`/api/connect/status`)
```typescript
- Fetches account from Stripe API
- Updates database with:
  * charges_enabled
  * payouts_enabled
  * onboarding_complete
- Returns status to frontend
```

### Money Flow

**For a 100 PLN event with 10 players (10 PLN each):**

```
Player pays 10 PLN
    ‚Üì
Stripe processes payment
    ‚Üì
Stripe fee deducted (~2.9% + 1 PLN = ~1.29 PLN)
    ‚Üì
Net amount transferred to organizer (~8.71 PLN)
    ‚Üì
Organizer receives in their Stripe balance
    ‚Üì
Organizer transfers to bank account
```

**Platform Fee (Optional, Currently Disabled):**
```typescript
application_fee_amount: Math.round(pricePerPlayer * 100 * 0.05) // 5%
```
- Would give platform 5% of each payment
- Commented out in code (line 90, simple-checkout/route.ts)

---

## üé® Frontend Architecture

### State Management

**Client-Side (React Context):**
- `AuthContext`: User state, login/logout functions
- `LanguageContext`: Multi-language support (EN/PL)

**Server-Side:**
- API routes fetch fresh data from Supabase
- Server Components use `createServerSupabaseClient()`
- No global server state (stateless)

### Styling Approach

**Tailwind CSS with custom components:**
```css
.btn-primary - Primary action button (blue)
.btn-secondary - Secondary action (gray)
.card - Container with shadow and padding
.input - Form input styling
.stat-card - Dashboard stats card
.progress-bar - Event funding progress
.participant-card - Participant list item
```

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- Stack on mobile, grid on desktop
